# Library

Copy any extra DLLs needed for compilation here.  Ideally the Git repo should only track this README, and the remaining files should be local-only copies of proprietary DLLs.  Any publicly available DLLs should be referenced in the `.csproj` file.  Proprietary DLLs (like game files) need to be copied here, but should not be committed to the repo.
